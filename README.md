# Profile-Based Subgroup Discovery (PSD)

This research introduces Profile-Based Subgroup Discovery, and compares it to two other subgroup discovery techniques: DFS and VLSD. 

Since this research is based on [PEBAM](https://github.com/mcwilms/PEBAM), we continued the work in notebooks as well. 

If you want to see just the results, we refer to Results Comparison/Visualize_results.ipynb.

For each of the methods, you will find their descriptive process in the following files:
- PSD: PSD_descriptions.ipynb and PSD_results.ipynb
- DFS: pysubgroup/DFS_GermanCredit.py and process_DFS_descriptions.ipynb
- VLSD: VLSD.ipynb and VLSD_results.ipynb

We would have liked to introduce a better pipeline, but due to time constraints we were not able to convert everything to python files.
